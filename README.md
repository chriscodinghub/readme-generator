## Welcome to my readme-generator!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.

+ I learned how to install node.js and dependancies.
+ I learned how to take user input and process the data into dynamically generated content.
+ I learned how to add specific data to objects with transform.
+ I learned how to specifically name newly created files dynamically.

## Functions of my App
+ With the app open and within your terminal, you will type node index.js
+ Then you will be asked a series of questions regarding the program you are creating.
+ The questions are tailored to fit the needs of your README.md file.
+ Once you have completed the questions you will see 'Success!' in your terminal.
+ Then you will go to the outputContent dirrectory and you will find your personalized README.md file titled with your projects name.md

## Future improvements/updates
+ In the future, I would like to design a front end page where a user can easily navigate and use this app without needing knowledge of terminal use.
